## Introduction
Digital Image Processing (DIP) is a fundamental field of computer science and electronics that focuses on manipulating and analyzing digital images using computational techniques. This project presents the practical implementation of key Digital Image Processing concepts using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

The notebook demonstrates how images can be enhanced, transformed, and analyzed through various image processing operations. The goal of this project is to provide hands-on exposure to DIP techniques and their real-world applications.
